        <p><h2>How to make potato salad step-by-step</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Combine potatoes and salt in a large pot filled with cold water. Bring to a boil.
                    <br>Cook until potatoes are tender, but not mushy, about 10 minutes depending on size. Drain and set aside until cool enough to handle.</li>
                    
                <li>While potatoes are cooking, whisk 3 tablespoons olive oil and white wine vinegar together in a small bowl. Add garlic and set aside.</li>
                <li>Peel cooked and cooled potatoes and cut into 1-inch cubes. Combine potatoes, green onions, and parsley in a bowl and lightly toss. <br> Season with salt and pepper. Drizzle with olive oil mixture and lightly toss, taking care not to break the potatoes.</li>
                <li>Top with remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil and red pepper flakes right before serving.</li>
            </ol>
